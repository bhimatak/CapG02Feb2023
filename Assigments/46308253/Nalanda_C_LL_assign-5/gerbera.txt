Even if you’ve never grown gerbera daisy plants in your garden, chances are you’ve enjoyed gerbera daisies indoors in cut flower arrangements and bouquets. With their large upturned flowers, vibrant colors, and long stems, gerbera daisies have earned their status as one of most popular cut flowers in the world.

Native to South Africa, gerbera daisies are tender perennials that can be grown outdoors as annuals in almost any climate. You’ll commonly find gerbera plants sold at garden centers in the spring, or you can buy a pack or two of seeds in the flower color and variety of your choice. With proper planting and a little attention, either option will bring bold splashes of color to your garden beds and containers all summer long.
