Q. Check whether a given number can be expressed as the sum of two prime number

i/p
Enter a positive integer: 34
Output
34 = 3 + 31

34 = 5 + 29
34 = 11 + 23
34 = 17 + 17
NoofWays = 4

Q. Problem Statement:
Given an array A of N positive numbers. The task is to find the position 
where equilibrium first occurs in the array. Equilibrium position in an array is a position such that the sum of elements before it is equal to the sum of   elements after it.

Input Format:
The first line contains an integer, denoting the size of the array. 
The second line contains integers denoting the elements 
of the array.

Constraints
1<= n<=100

1<=arr<= 1000, where arr is the ith element of the array.

Output Format:
The output line contains integer denoting an equilibrium
index (if any) or -1 (if no equilibrium indexes exist).

TESTCASE 1:
Input:
7
[-7, 1, 5, 2, -4, 3, 0]
Output: 
3
