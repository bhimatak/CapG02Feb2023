Array 

- storing homogenious data elements/value used for particular purpose
- elements are stored in consective mem address
- identified by binary unix operator - []
- elements starts from 0th index to size-1 
- each elements are identified by their own index values

syntax:

	declaration of arrays:

		dataType identifierName[Size of the array];

	to access data elements/members of the array:

		identifierName[index value];


				 0,1,2
int RollNo[4] = {1,2,3}; //dec with initialisation

int Test[4] = {1};

int t1[]; x




printf("\n%d",Test[3]);



RollNo[2] = 44;

printf("\n%d",RollNo[4]);



RollNo[49] = 10101;

RollNo[999] 


1. one dimension
2. two / multi

following are type of array,

1. static array
	: size of the array is know before to the execution time/ @ the time of coding

2. dynamic array
	: size of array is known/set at the time of run time/execution time
		sys. libs called malloc, calloc, realloc => DMA

3. stretchable array
	: size of the array is shrinked/extended @ run time
		sys libs: malloc, calloc, realloc

4. mutable array
	: size of the array is known/alloted between link and build time.
	it resembles like a static


tips/tricks
			0,1,2,3,4
int a[5] = {1,2,3,4,5};

printf("\n%d", a[2]);

printf("\n%d",a[a[1]]);

printf("\n%d %d",a[2],3[a]);
